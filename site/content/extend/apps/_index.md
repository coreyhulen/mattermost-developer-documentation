Apps are lighweight interactive add-ons to Mattermost. Apps can:

- Display interactive, dynamic Modal forms and Message Actions.
- Attach themselves to locations in the Mattermost UI (e.g. channel bar buttons, post menu, channel menu, commands), and can add their custom /commands with full Autocomplete.
- Receive webhooks from Mattermost, and third-parties, and use the Mattermost REST APIs to post messages, etc.
- Be hosted externally (HTTP), on Mattermost Cloud (AWS Lambda), and soon in self-managed as well as customers' own AWS environments.
- Be developed in any language*.

Apps are available as a Developers Preview and we're looking for your feedback! Share constructive feedback in the [Mattermost Apps channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/mattermost-apps) on our Mattermost community instance.
