### Mentor For The Day
- Schedule a 1-1 each day between new staff and team members (including QA and PM) and other devs who would be relevant to meet with for the first two weeks
  - These meetings should be about 30 minutes and do not need to be focused on work topics. They should spend some time getting to know each other
  - The first 1-1 should be between you and the new staff member
- In addition to the above 1-1s, you should meet personally with the new staff member for 5-10 minutes every day for the first week or so to make sure everything is going well

### Channels and Teams
- Make sure new staff is added to the private team `Private Core` and all relevant channels
- See [here](/internal/onboarding/new-staff-guide#channels-and-teams) for basic list of channels

### Meetings and Accounts
- Add new staff member to all appropriate meetings
