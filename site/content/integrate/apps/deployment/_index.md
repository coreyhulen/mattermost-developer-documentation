Serverless hosting allows for easy app installation from the App Marketplace by a System Admin and uses AWS Lambda serverless technology instead of relying on a physical server. Developers who create apps using a serverless development approach can easily deploy apps securely, efficiently, and at scale in the Mattermost Cloud.

## Deployment to AWS

### App Bundle

An app bundle is a convenient way to deliver an app to the Mattermost ecosystem. It provides a way to organize code and resources needed for an app to run. An app bundle is created by the developer of the app. Mattermost uses app bundles to provision and install/uninstall apps.

The app bundle contains a `manifest.json` file, a `static/` folder (optional), and one or several lambda function bundles.

- The `static/` folder contains all the static files the app needs. For the Mattermost AWS apps, static files are automatically provisioned and stored in the dedicated AWS S3 bucket. Apps have unlimited access to them by providing the static file name to the Apps Plugin. For the third-party hosted AWS apps, static files are stored in a different S3 bucket (specified by the third-party). For the HTTP apps, when creating a server, the developer should store the static files in the `/static/$FILE_NAME` relative URL.
- The `manifest.json` file contains details about the app such as appID, appVersion, appType (HTTP or an AWS app), requested permissions, requested locations, and information about the functions such as function path, name, runtime, and handler.
- Each of the lambda function bundles is a valid and runnable AWS Lambda function, provisioned in AWS by the [Mattermost Apps Cloud Deployer](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-apps-cloud-deployer). The AWS Lambda function bundle is a `.zip` file which contains scripts or compiled programs and their dependencies. Note that it must be smaller than 50 MB. Exact specification of the bundle varies for different runtimes. For example one can see more details for `node.js` bundles [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-package.html).

### Making your app runnable as an AWS Lambda function

In order for your app to run as an AWS Lambda function it must use one of the supported languages for AWS Lambda. You can find the list [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html).

It's important to design an app in a _stateless_ way, as its lifetime only spans one request. No persistent information should be stored except using the [store API endpoints]({{< ref "using-mattermost-api#apps-kv-store-api" >}}) provided by the Apps Framework.

A language library is used to emulate an HTTP to your app. For go you might use https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-go-api-proxy.

Finally you need to define the AWS function in the manifest of your app by adding `aws_lambda` to it which has the following fields:

| Name      | Description                                                                                                  |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`    | The lambda function with its path being the longest-matching prefix of the call's path which will be invoked for a call. |
| `name`    | A human-readable name.                                                                                       |
| `handler` | The name of the handler function.                                                                            |
| `runtime` | The AWS Lambda runtime to use.                                                                               |

For a go app the manifest snippet would look like this:

```json
{
    "aws_lambda": [
        {
            "path": "/",
            "name": "go-function",
            "handler": "$YOUR_APP_NAME",
            "runtime": "go1.x"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Setting up your Mattermost instance and AWS for deploying third-party apps

Note that third-party apps are not supported in the Mattermost Cloud - they're used only for developer testing convenience. Provisioning in the third-party AWS cloud environment is done by the **appsctl** tool after completing the environment set up.

We need an app bundle to provision an app. The bundle might be provisioned from the local disk, from S3 (not implemented yet), or from a URL (not implemented yet). Provisioning consists of three parts which will be completed via the **appsctl** tool:

1. Creating the lambda functions with appropriate policies.
2. Storing static assets in the dedicated S3 bucket.
3. Storing the appâ€™s manifest file in the same dedicated S3 bucket.

#### Mattermost setup

Follow the Prerequisites section of the [JS](../quick-start-js) or [GO](../quick-start-go) Quick Start Guides to set up your Mattermost instance. Ensure that you install the [apps plugin](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/apps/quick-start-js/#install-the-apps-plugin) as part of this process.

#### AWS setup

##### 1. Create an IAM user and access key and secret

You will need to create IAM user and an access key and secret so that `appsctl` can provision the app. Please follow the instructions [provided by AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/) to complete these steps and save the `Access key ID` and `Secret access key`.

##### 2. Create AWS S3 bucket

You will need to create an S3 bucket within AWS.

1. Visit https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com
1. Create a bucket.
1. **Bucket name**: Give your bucket a name.
1. **AWS Region**:
    1. Select your region
    1. Save the slug value for later (Example: `us-east-1`)
    1. Corresponding Lambdas will be provisioned in the same region
1. **Block Public Access settings for this bucket**
    1. Uncheck **Block *all* public access**
    1. Check **Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies**
    1. Check **Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies**
    1. Check **I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public.**
1. Select **Create Bucket**.

##### 3. Set AWS environment variables

Open a terminal where you installed the Apps plugin and set the following variables to the AWS credentials just created:

`MM_APPS_PROVISION_AWS_ACCESS_KEY`  
`MMMM_APPS_PROVISION_AWS_SECRET_KEY_APPS_PROVISION_AWS_SECRET_KEY`

Set the following environment variables based on bucket name and region

`MM_APPS_S3_BUCKET`  
`MM_APPS_AWS_REGION`

##### 4. Initialize the AWS resources

The following command will create a Mattermost invoke user and security policy for use with AWS.

`go run ./cmd/appsctl aws init --create --create-access-key`

The output of the command will contain two "Invoke" environment variables. Set
these variables in the location of your running Mattermost server repo.

- `MM_APPS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY`
- `MM_APPS_AWS_SECRET_KEY`

#### Restart the Mattermost Server

Ensure you have the following environment variables set.

- `MM_APPS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY`
- `MM_APPS_AWS_SECRET_KEY`
- `MM_APPS_S3_BUCKET`
- `MM_APPS_AWS_REGION`

Restart the Mattermost server to complete your Mattermost and AWS setup. You can now deploy an app to AWS.

**Optional:** Test commands are available if you would like to validate your AWS configuration and permissions

Build hello-lambda bundle

`cd ./examples/go/hello-lambda && make dist`

Test the environment

```
go run ./cmd/appsctl aws test provision ./examples/go/hello-lambda/dist/bundle.zip
go run ./cmd/appsctl aws test lambda
go run ./cmd/appsctl aws test s3
```

### Deploying a third-party apps to AWS

After setting up your Mattermost instance, AWS key, and S3 bucket you can now provision your app using `appsctl`. Note that `appsctl` commands are run in the `mattermost-plugin-apps` repo.

Install appsctl  

- `go install github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-apps/cmd/appsctl@latest`

Provision your app  

- `appsctl provision app /PATH/TO/YOUR/APP/BUNDLE.zip`

#### Provisioned app details

AWS Lambda functions have semantic names, which means that a function described in the `manifest.json` file translates to AWS as `$appID_$appVersion_$functionName` to avoid collisions with other apps' or other versions' functions. And **appsctl** provisions lambda functions using this name. For example the name of a `servicenow` app's lambda function might be `com-mattermost-servicenow_0-1-0_go-function`. You don't need to worry about the AWS Lambda function names, as the Apps Plugin takes care of it. The dedicated S3 bucket name is stored in the environment variable: `MM_APPS_S3_BUCKET`.

This also stores all apps' static assets and manifest files.

All files in the static folder of the bundle are considered to be the app's static assets and are stored in the above-mentioned bucket. Stored assets also have semantic keys and are generated using the rule - `static/$appID_$appVersion/filename`. For example the `servicenow` app's static file key can be `"static/com.mattermost.servicenow_0.1.0_app/photo.png"`. You don't need to worry about the static asset keys, as the Apps Plugin takes care of it.

The `manifest.json` file of an app is stored in the same S3 bucket as the key - `manifests/$appID_$appVersion.json`.

### Provisioning in Mattermost Cloud

In order to be provisioned in Mattermost Cloud an app bundle is uploaded to the specific S3 bucket. On a new app release, a bundle is created by GitLab CI and uploaded to S3. The [Mattermost apps cloud deployer](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-apps-cloud-deployer), running as a k8s cron job every hour, detects the S3 upload, and creates appropriate lambda functions, assets, and manifest the same way the **appsclt** does for the third-party accounts.

The deployer needs lambda function names, asset keys, and the manifest key to provision the app. It calls the `aws.GetProvisionDataFromFile(/PATH/TO/THE/APP/BUNDLE)` from the Apps Plugin to get the provision data. Same data can be generated using the command:

`appsctl generate-terraform-data /PATH/TO/YOUR/APP/BUNDLE`

## HTTP server

While a serverless infrastructure is the recommended way to host apps, they can be hosted as a traditional HTTP server (for example, using `systemd`). It's important that your app is only reachable by the Mattermost server, and not the public internet.

## Submit to Marketplace

TBD
