# Mobile Apps

The Mattermost mobile apps are written in [JavaScript](https://golang.org/) using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

It is powered by [mattermost-redux](/contribute/redux) which handles the majority of the logic, client-side storage and server communication.
