### Build Preparations

First of all, ensure that the following remains exactly the same as in the original [mattermost-mobile](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile) repo:

- The package ID for the Android app and the Bundle Identifier for the iOS app remain the same as the one in the original mattermost-mobile repo, com.mattermost.rnbeta.
- Android-specific source files remain under `android/app/src/main/java/com/mattermost/rnbeta`
- Your [environment variables](/contribute/mobile/build-your-own/environment-vars) are set according to your needs
