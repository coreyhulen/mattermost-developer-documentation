Every time a change is made to the source code, we'll need to make sure to add or update tests as needed, this will ensure that the code that was introduced is not breaking the app in other places.


TODO:
- [ ] Add steps to write unit tests & e2e tests
- [ ] List the npm commands to run tests & lint checks
