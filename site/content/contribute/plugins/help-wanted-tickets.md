Each plugin's Help Wanted tickets are located in the respective plugin's GitHub repository. In order to browse all of the open tickets, see [this issue](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues/12656) in the server repository with links to specific plugin repositories, and queries for Help Wanted tickets in each repository. The "All Plugins Up for Grabs" link there is useful to browse all repositories at once.
