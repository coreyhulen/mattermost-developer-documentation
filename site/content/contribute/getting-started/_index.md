# Getting Started

Welcome to the Mattermost project!

We're very glad that you want to help contribute and our goal here is to make that as easy as possible.

First you'll need to decide which part(s) of the project you'll want to contribute to. There are a number of different pieces that make up the entirety of Mattermost and each of these pieces fills a purpose in the overall Mattermost architecture and vision. Click through each to learn more:

* [Server](/contribute/server/) - The highly scalable Mattermost server
* [Webapp](/contribute/webapp/) - The browser webapp built with React
* [Mobile](/contribute/mobile/) - The Android and iOS apps built with React Native
* [Desktop](/contribute/desktop/) - The Electron desktop app that wraps the webapp
* [Redux](/contribute/redux/) - The Redux-based web, storage and logic driver of the web and mobile apps

There are some smaller parts of the project not listed here, [see the project repositories page for a full list](/contribute/getting-started/respositories/).

Each part of the project will have it's own developer setup instructions, your next step should be to set up your machine using one of those.

Unsure where you want to contribute? [Try starting with the server](/contribute/server/developer-setup/).

Finally, before you go submitting any code please give [our contribution guidelines a read](/contribute/getting-started/contribution-guidelines/).
